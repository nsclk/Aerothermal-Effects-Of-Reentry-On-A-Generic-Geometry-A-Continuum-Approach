# Aerothermal-Effects-Of-Reentry-On-A-Generic-Geometry-A-Continuum-Approach
The design of hypersonic air vehicles must take into account the aerothermodynamic loads caused by shock wave
boundary layer interactions (shock interactions). The accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software
SU2-NEMO in predicting these hypersonic shock wave laminar boundary layer interactions is evaluated. SU2-NEMO,
a recent enhancement to the open-source SU2 multi-physics suite, introduces improved capabilities for handling high-
enthalpy and high-Mach number flows. Computations performed using SU2 are presented for a generic body
(cylinder) and compared with experimental data. The results demonstrate the current strengths and limitations of
modern CFD methods for these types of flows.
